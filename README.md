# Huffman_Compression


This code defines functions to build a Huffman tree from the frequency counts of symbols in a file, 
build a table of Huffman codes from the tree, 
compress a file using the codes, 
and decompress a compressed file using the original Huffman tree. 
The main function of the program takes two command-line arguments, 
the name of the input file and the name of the output file,
and compresses and decompresses the input file to the output file using the Huffman algorithm.
